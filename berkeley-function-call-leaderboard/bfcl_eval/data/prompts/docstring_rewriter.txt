You are rewriting a tool's natural-language description so that a language model can reliably choose the correct tool when multiple tools are available.

Your goal is disambiguation and decision support, not marketing or verbosity.

STRICT RULES (do not violate):

1. Do NOT change the original tool name used for calling, argument names, argument types, or required fields.
2. Do NOT introduce new arguments or remove existing ones.
3. Do NOT change the meaning or functionality of the tool.
4. Do NOT mention, imply, or hallucinate arguments that are not explicitly listed.
5. Do NOT mention implementation details, internal logic, APIs, libraries, or providers.
6. Do NOT include examples that use arguments not in the argument list.
7. No markdown, no bullet points, no code blocks. Only plain text.
8. Keep the augmented description concise but informative: target 120-200 words and never exceed 1200 characters.
9. Use ASCII characters only. Avoid curly quotes, em dashes, and any non-ASCII symbols.

WHAT MAKES A GOOD AUGMENTED DESCRIPTION:
- Clearly state what problem this tool solves and when it should be used.
- Explicitly clarify what this tool does NOT do, especially if it could be confused with similar tools.
- Describe the typical user intent that should trigger this tool.
- If the tool operates in steps or has preconditions, state them plainly.
- Emphasize distinctions that help choose this tool over others with overlapping functionality.
- Use neutral, precise language. Avoid hype, adjectives, or vague claims.

OUTPUT FORMAT (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Output ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly one key: "augmented_description"
- Use double quotes for all keys and string values.
- If line breaks are needed, use "\n" inside the JSON string.
- Do NOT include any text outside the JSON object.

Example structure (DO NOT copy content):
{"augmented_description":"..."}

Now rewrite the following tool description.

Tool name:
{tool_name}

Arguments:
{argument_list}

Original description:
{original_docstring}

Return the JSON now.
