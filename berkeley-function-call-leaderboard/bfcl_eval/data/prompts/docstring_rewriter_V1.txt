You rewrite tool metadata so that a language model can reliably choose the correct tool when multiple tools are available.

Your goal is disambiguation and decision support, not marketing or verbosity.

You must produce TWO outputs:
1. an augmented tool name (a clearer DISPLAY name for selection),
2. an augmented description (a clearer tool description for selection).

IMPORTANT: The original tool name is the ONLY name that can be used for calling the tool. The augmented tool name is a label shown to the model to help it choose, but it must NOT be treated as the callable name.

STRICT RULES (do not violate):

1. Do NOT change the tool's callable name, argument names, argument types, or required fields.
2. Do NOT introduce new arguments or remove existing ones.
3. Do NOT change the meaning or functionality of the tool.
4. Do NOT mention, imply, or hallucinate arguments that are not explicitly listed.
5. Do NOT mention implementation details, internal logic, APIs, libraries, or providers.
6. Do NOT include examples that use arguments not in the argument list.
7. No markdown, no bullet points, no code blocks. Only plain text.
8. Keep the augmented description concise but informative: target 120-200 words and never exceed 1200 characters.
9. Use ASCII characters only. Avoid curly quotes, em dashes, and any non-ASCII symbols.

WHAT MAKES A GOOD AUGMENTED DESCRIPTION:
- Clearly state what problem this tool solves and when it should be used.
- Explicitly clarify what this tool does NOT do, especially if it could be confused with similar tools.
- Describe the typical user intent that should trigger this tool.
- If the tool has preconditions or expects certain inputs, state them plainly using only the listed arguments.
- Emphasize distinctions that help choose this tool over others with overlapping functionality.
- Use neutral, precise language. Avoid hype, adjectives, or vague claims.

WHAT MAKES A GOOD AUGMENTED TOOL NAME (DISPLAY NAME):
- The name should be short, specific, and human readable.
- It should summarize the tool's primary action + domain/object (e.g., "create calendar event", "search web", "attach java agent").
- Prefer verb-first phrasing.
- Avoid generic words like "tool", "helper", "manager".
- Do NOT include argument values or examples.
- Do NOT include provider names or internal project names.
- Keep it concise: target 3-7 words and never exceed 60 characters.
- Use ASCII only.

OUTPUT FORMAT (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Output ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly TWO keys:
  "augmented_name"
  "augmented_description"
- Use double quotes for all keys and string values.
- If line breaks are needed, use "\n" inside the JSON string.
- Do NOT include any text outside the JSON object.

Example structure (DO NOT copy content):
{"augmented_name":"...","augmented_description":"..."}

Now rewrite the following tool metadata.

Callable tool name (MUST NOT CHANGE):
{tool_name}

Arguments:
{argument_list}

Original description:
{original_docstring}

Return the JSON now.
