  "aug_description": "Use this tool to verify that an environment variable map has the expected number of entries and a consistent empty/non-empty state. Call it when you need to check that a given map of environment variables (environ) matches an expected size (size) and that all internal views of this map agree on that size. The tool inspects the provided environ as a whole and compares its size to the integer value in size, also ensuring that the reported emptiness of the map is consistent with that expected size. This tool does not modify the map, read from any external environment, or infer the expected size; you must supply both the map and the expected size explicitly. Prefer this tool when the main goal is to validate structural consistency and expected entry count of an environment variable map, not to read or update individual environment variables.",
